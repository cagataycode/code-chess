The CODE Chess Club runs a semester-long league where every player faces off against 
others in their division. Each semester, the league resets â€” giving everyone a fresh 
chance to climb the ranks and prove their chess prowess.

Matches are scheduled weekly, with fixture lists posted in advance. Players arrange 
their matches during the week to keep the league moving smoothly.
